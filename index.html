            <p>Shakira has done many things in her life in terms of accomplishments, she easily has one of the best voices in the music industry and her songs are very enjoyable, but other than music, her biggest accomplishment was that she founded the barefoot foundation in 1997. She founded this in Colombia as It is a charity to help poor and impoverished kids to get quality education. This treuly shows how kind Shakira is and how much she really cares for other people that aren't as fortunate as she is. <br>
